This project may not work with the latest Bukkit version (or at all) and may not receive any further updates by myself however, feel free to fork this and make improvements. I'll certainly consider any pull requests made and will try to assist with any issues.

#CreativeDropToDelete

What it does:
- Removes any item dropped by a player in creative mode instead of the item collecting on the ground
- Exceptions are managed via permissions
- That is literally all it does
